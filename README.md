## Special Thanks
* [cswendrowski](https://github.com/cswendrowski) for starting Foundry
* https://www.theworldofpokemon.com/ for their amazing pokedex entries 
* The amazing people and their amazing feedback, over at the [PTR Dev Server](https://discord.gg/ptrfvtt)
* npaisley for doing a lot of the backend stuff; I am not a coder in any capacity, and having to work with abandonware was a daunting task that I could never have completed without their support.
