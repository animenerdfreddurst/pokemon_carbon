All but 19 of these are not made by me, and even those 19 are questionable.
The goal here is to consolidate all relevant token art into one place, with a consistent naming scheme for use in Pokemon Carbon.
This is all you will ever get, do not ask for updates or changes.

The majority of tokens are from Pokemon.com (non-shiny) and Tonofdirt726's imgbb (shiny).
The exceptions:
-Alcremie forms are from Bulbapedia
-Vivillon 2-19, Minior 2-8, Flabebe 2-4, Floette 2-4, Florges 2-4, Eiscue No Ice, Mimikyu Busted, Furfrou 5-10, Unown (not F), and Silvally (not Normal type) non-shiny forms are from ZarxielZerg on DeviantArt
-Vivillon shiny forms 2-19 and Darmanitan-G Zen Mode are made by me using Paint3D with the above bases (cringe, I know)
-Furfrou shiny forms 5-10 are from Fernando0314 on DeviantArt
-Darmanitan-Zen shiny and non-shiny are from Xous54 on DeviantArt
-Unown shiny forms are from Analisi Pokemon Wiki
-Minior shiny forms are from Bulbapedia
-Castform non-shiny forms (not no weather) are from Bulbapedia and scaled up using cutout.pro
-Eiscue No Ice and Mimikyu Busted shiny forms are from Pokemon HOME
If any of these people stole art from somewhere/someone else, I do not care enough to find out.

I think the file nomenclature is pretty straightforward, but just in case:
-All pokemon are named based on their number
-If a pokemon has an alternate forms other than mega, all of them use the name of that form (ex: _zen, _hangry, _alolan)
-Type shifts are treated as alternate forms, with the type given as the name of the form and note that order MATTERS (ex: a Fire/Ghost Ninetales would be _FireGhost)
-Megas are simply "_mega", with subsequent forms either numbered or given a relevant letter
-Gender is denoted by an f after the number
-Shinies are denoted with an s after the number; this and gender are alphabetical

Minior's base form has no shiny.
Alcremie shiny only has one per topping, cream doesn't matter.
